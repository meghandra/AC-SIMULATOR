Connecting keypad to arduino through respective column keys and row keys as written in code

We take keys input via loop and stop when # is pressed  converting it to an integer and print it on lcd via lcd.print()statement 

But unfortunately the code worked well when none other component was used but diddnt worked in full circuit 

Hope to learn it when i get onboarded to teamkart if possible could u pls tell why Serial.print()was also not working

2.lcd:
I have used lcd i2c instead of usual lcd as it requires less pin connections


Initializing lcd and light its backlight

Setting the cursor and printing fanspeed and temperature
3.dc motor and potentiometer:
I thought that for a knob at our temperature control system we can use potentiometer for this purpose

Potentiometer is a device basically which has 3 terminals which consists of 2 to ground and power and 3rd as wiper 

If we rotate the knob basically vout increases or decreases as load resistance increases/decreases

This variable voltage is taken in analog pin from(0,1023) then its feed into digital pin https://lastminuteengineers.com/i2c-lcd-arduino-tutorial/


4.dc motor:
Motor is used to run as a fan in our system
I  had calibrated the fan speed by considireing linear plot between fanspeed and rpm

4.Temperature sensor:
I had connected tmp 36 for this purpose

I had connected the sensor pin to an analog pin
 
This signal will be further used to calculate temperature in degree celsius

5.push button :
	When in on position creates a high voltage and when in off creates low voltage

We can count n.o of times giving high and store it in say i then power the circuit via condition 

If i is odd the power on
